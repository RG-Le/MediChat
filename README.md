# MediChat
This is a chatbot that uses LLM ("Llama2") to answer any medical query.

The knowledge base used are pdfs from many research papers and medical textbooks.

The model is quite slow as its made to run on any cpu machines. Thus avg response time for any query is around 2-3 mins.


Clone it and install the dependencies from requirements.txt

Run **chainlit run model.py -w**
